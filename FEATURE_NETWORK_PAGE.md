# Feature: Network Page - Contact Details & Relationship History

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive network page that shows people you've interacted with and detailed views of your relationship history with each contact.

## Components

### 1. Network List Page (`/dashboard/network`)
**Location**: `app/routes/dashboard/network.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Lists all people you've had conversations with
- ✅ Shows contact avatar, name, email
- ✅ Displays conversation count and total transcript turns
- ✅ Shows last interaction time
- ✅ Sorted by most recent interaction
- ✅ Click to view detailed contact profile

**Fixed**:
- Updated navigation links from `/network` to `/dashboard/network` in:
  - `app/routes/dashboard/index.tsx`
  - `app/routes/record.tsx`

### 2. Contact Detail Page (`/dashboard/network/$userId`)
**Location**: `app/routes/dashboard/network/$userId.tsx` (NEW)

**Features**:
- ✅ **Contact Header**: Avatar, name, email, summary stats
- ✅ **Statistics Cards**:
  - Your contributions (transcript turns)
  - Their contributions (transcript turns)
- ✅ **All Conversations**: 
  - Chronological list of all conversations with this person
  - Date, duration, status, summary, location
  - Click to open specific conversation
- ✅ **Shared Facts Sidebar**:
  - "What You Know About Them" - Facts extracted about the contact
  - "What They Know About You" - Facts extracted about you
- ✅ **Analytics**:
  - Total conversation count
  - Total time spent in conversations
  - Conversation breakdown by status

### 3. Backend API (`convex/network.ts`)

#### Existing: `list` Query
Returns all contacts with summary stats

#### NEW: `getContactDetails` Query
**Purpose**: Get comprehensive information about a specific contact

**Returns**:
```typescript
{
  contact: {
    _id, name, email, image
  },
  conversations: [
    // All conversations with this person, sorted by most recent
  ],
  sharedFacts: {
    currentUserFacts: string[],  // Facts about you
    contactFacts: string[],       // Facts about them
  },
  stats: {
    totalConversations: number,
    totalDuration: number,        // in milliseconds
    currentUserTurns: number,     // Your transcript contributions
    contactTurns: number,         // Their transcript contributions
  }
}
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Fetches all conversations where current user and contact both participated
- Aggregates facts from all conversations
- Calculates total duration and turn counts
- Deduplicates facts across conversations

## User Flow

1. **Navigate to Network**: Click "Network" in bottom navigation
2. **View Contacts**: See all people you've interacted with
3. **Select Contact**: Click on any person to view details
4. **View Relationship**: See:
   - Complete conversation history with that person
   - What you've learned about them
   - What they've learned about you
   - Interaction statistics
5. **Open Conversation**: Click any conversation to view full transcript

## Use Cases

### 1. Pre-Meeting Preparation
- Quickly review what you know about someone before a call
- See what they know about you
- Review previous conversation summaries

### 2. Relationship Insights
- Track how often you interact with someone
- See conversation patterns
- Review accumulated knowledge over time

### 3. Context Retrieval
- Find specific past conversations with someone
- Access historical facts and discussions
- Review meeting outcomes

## Technical Implementation

### Routing Structure
```
/dashboard
  /network              → List of all contacts
    /$userId            → Detailed view of specific contact
```

### Data Flow
```
User clicks contact
  ↓
Navigate to /dashboard/network/$userId
  ↓
Query: network.getContactDetails(contactId)
  ↓
Fetch:
  - User info
  - All conversations between current user & contact
  - All facts from those conversations
  - Calculate stats
  ↓
Render:
  - Contact header
  - Stats cards
  - Conversation list
  - Facts sidebar
```

### Performance Considerations
- Conversations fetched once and cached by React Query
- Facts deduplicated to avoid showing duplicates
- Most recent conversations shown first
- Optimized queries using Convex indexes

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Conversation Analytics**:
   - Speaking time ratio visualization
   - Topic trends over time
   - Sentiment analysis

2. **Relationship Metrics**:
   - Connection strength score
   - Engagement trends
   - Response patterns

3. **Smart Insights**:
   - AI-generated relationship summary
   - Suggested topics to discuss
   - Important updates/changes

4. **Search & Filter**:
   - Search conversations
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by topic/keywords

5. **Export Options**:

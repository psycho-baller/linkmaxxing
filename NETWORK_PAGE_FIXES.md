# Network Page - Issues Fixed & Features Implemented

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Route Registration
**Problem**: Network pages existed but weren't registered in the router
**Fixed**: Added routes to `app/routes.ts`:
```typescript
route("dashboard/network", "routes/dashboard/network.tsx"),
route("dashboard/network/:userId", "routes/dashboard/network/$userId.tsx"),
```

### 2. ✅ Incorrect Navigation Links
**Problem**: Links pointed to `/network` instead of `/dashboard/network`
**Fixed**: Updated navigation in:
- `app/routes/dashboard/index.tsx`
- `app/routes/record.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Wrong Conversation Route
**Problem**: New contact detail page used `/record/:id` instead of `/dashboard/conversations/:id`
**Fixed**: Updated navigation in contact detail page

### 4. ✅ Missing Contact Detail View
**Problem**: Network page only navigated to last conversation, not showing relationship overview
**Solution**: Created comprehensive contact detail page at `/dashboard/network/$userId`

## Technical Implementation

### Analytics Calculations

All metrics are calculated client-side from the existing contact details data:

```typescript
const analytics = {
  yourBalance: Math.round((currentUserTurns / totalTurns) * 100),
  contactBalance: Math.round((contactTurns / totalTurns) * 100),
  avgDuration: totalDuration / conversationCount,
  avgDaysBetween: timeSpan / (conversationCount - 1),
  locations: aggregateLocations(),
  statusBreakdown: countByStatus(),
  engagementScore: totalTurns / conversationCount
}
```

### Performance

- No additional API calls required
- Calculations use existing data from `getContactDetails` query
- Instant toggle - no loading time
- Memoized calculations via React

### Responsive Design

- 2-column grid on desktop
- Single column on mobile
